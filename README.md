## 📖 Overview

`soroban-budget-assert` is a developer tool that measures the gap between local Soroban test estimates and real network costs. It allows developers to assert budget limits during testing and automatically generate detailed execution-resource reports across an entire workspace.

### 🏗️ Architecture

The tool is split into two primary components:

1. **`budget-macros` (Tier A - Local, Fast, CI-Blocking)**
   - Rust macros (`#[budget_cpu_lt(N)]`, `#[budget_mem_lt(N)]`) applied directly to your test functions.
   - Fails the test the moment measured cost crosses your pinned limit, so cost regressions are caught in CI instead of on the network.

2. **`cargo-budget-report` (Tier B - Network-Verified, Reporting)**
   - A CLI tool that automatically discovers all contracts in your workspace.
   - Compiles WASM, simulates execution on testnet, and reports the simulated resource amounts (CPU instructions, read/write bytes).
   - These are inputs to the non-refundable resource fee — not a total cost. Rent, refundable fees, transaction size, footprint entry counts, and the inclusion fee are not measured; see [Measurement scope](https://tollcraft.gitbook.io/docs/budget-assert/reference#measurement-scope).
   - Configurable via a central `budget.toml` file.

### 🧪 Test Fixture: Constant-Product AMM Pool

The workspace includes `amm-pool-contract`, a constant-product AMM pool fixture that replaces the original `ExpensiveContract` synthetic loop. It exercises the operations that dominate real Soroban costs:

- **Multiple persistent storage keys** — reserves, balances, LP shares, per-user state
- **Authorization** — `require_auth()` on every state-changing operation
- **Event emission** — deposit, swap, and withdraw events
- **Realistic computation** — constant-product math with slippage checks
- **Simulated token flows** — internal balance tracking across pool operations

The fixture is a benchmark, not a product. It implements `initialize`, `deposit`, `swap`, and `withdraw` — enough to produce meaningful cost numbers but small enough to stay readable.

**`do_expensive_work`** is retained as a deliberately named synthetic baseline. Its CPU-bound loop exercises almost none of the host functions that drive real contract costs, making it useful as a comparison point to measure the gap between synthetic benchmarks and realistic contract operations.

## ⚙️ Supported Versions & Compatibility

* **Supported SDK Version**: `soroban-sdk` = `"22.0.0"` (specifically tested/resolved to `22.0.11` in `Cargo.lock`)
* **Supported XDR Version**: `stellar-xdr` = `"22.1.0"` (used for decoding transaction simulation responses)
* **Corresponding Stellar Protocol**: **Protocol 22**

### Compatibility Matrix

| SDK Version | Protocol Version | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`< 22.0.0`** | `< 22` | **Untested** | Older protocols may use different transaction/resource schemas. |
| **`22.0.x`** | `22` | **Supported** | Matches pinned manifest dependencies (`soroban-sdk` `22.0.0`, `stellar-xdr` `22.1.0`). |
| **`>= 23.0.0`** | `>= 23` | **Untested** | Future protocol upgrades or XDR schema changes (e.g. key/field renames) may break parsing. |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation
Install the CLI tool locally from the repository root:
```bash
cargo install --path cargo-budget-report
```

### 2. Configuration
Create a `budget.toml` in your workspace root:
```toml
network = "testnet"
source = "alice"

[functions.do_expensive_work]
args = ["--n", "10000"]
```

### 3. Usage

**Generate a Workspace Report:**
```bash
cargo budget-report
```

**Filter by Package and Function:**
```bash
cargo budget-report --package example-contract --function do_expensive_work
```

The `--package` and `--function` flags can be repeated to select multiple items:
```bash
cargo budget-report --package contract-a --package contract-b --function init --function transfer
```

Unknown package or function names produce a clear error listing available candidates.

**Contract ID Caching:**

A `.budget-cache.toml` file (automatically gitignored) caches deployed contract IDs keyed by WASM SHA-256 hash and network. On subsequent runs with unchanged WASM, deployment is skipped and the cached ID is reused:

```bash
# First run — deploys and caches
cargo budget-report

# Second run (no WASM changes) — reuses cached contract IDs (fast)
cargo budget-report
```

To force re-deployment:
```bash
cargo budget-report --force-deploy
```

Cache entries are isolated by network — a testnet ID will never be reused on another network.

**Use Macros in Tests:**

The macros (`budget_cpu_lt`, `budget_mem_lt`) are attribute macros for test functions. They require a local variable named **`env`** — the generated code reads `env.cost_estimate().budget()` by name.

```rust
use budget_macros::{budget_cpu_lt, budget_mem_lt};
use soroban_sdk::Env;

// CPU instruction assertion using the AMM pool fixture
#[test]
#[budget_cpu_lt(2500000)] // local WASM ~2,307,555
fn test_cpu_budget() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let contract_id = env.register(ConstantProductPool, ());
    let client = ConstantProductPoolClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    client.initialize();

    env.cost_estimate().budget().reset_unlimited();
    client.deposit(&user, &10_000_i128, &10_000_i128);
    client.swap(&user, &true, &100_i128, &90_i128);
    client.withdraw(&user, &1_000_i128, &900_i128, &900_i128);
}

// Memory assertion — same shape
#[test]
#[budget_mem_lt(2000000)] // local WASM ~1,589,080
fn test_mem_budget() {
    let env = Env::default();
    // register, initialize, reset_unlimited, deposit + swap + withdraw
}
```

## 📊 Measurements

The [MEASUREMENTS.md](MEASUREMENTS.md) file at the repository root records all empirical cost measurements comparing local Soroban budget estimates against real network costs. The [Protocol Mechanics documentation](https://tollcraft.gitbook.io/docs/budget-assert/protocol-mechanics) cites this file as the source of truth for measured figures.
